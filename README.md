# Repository for the latitudinal CNDD analysis by Hülsmann et al.

We used repeated census data from twenty-three large forest sites around the globe to analyze latitudinal patterns in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD).

## Methodology

We analyzed latitudinal patterns in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) following a three-step approach: First, we fitted species-site-specific mortality models from repeated observations of individual trees. Second, we used these models to quantify CNDD for each species and site using an estimator designed to maximize robustness, comparability, and relevance for fitness and stabilization. Third, we used meta-regressions to explore latitudinal patterns in CNDD. Robustness of the analysis pipeline was validated by model diagnostics and randomization.
